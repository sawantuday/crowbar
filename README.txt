  What is this?
  -------------

  Crowbar is a web scraping environment based on the use of a 
  server-side headless mozilla-based browser. It is used as a 
  a research prototype to investigate how to enable the running 
  of Piggy Bank javascript scrapers from the command line and
  thus automating web sites scraping.
